title: "Serverless Computing"
subtext: "Focus on your code"
description: "Serverless computing is a cloud computing model where the cloud provider runs the server, and dynamically manages the allocation of machine resources. You don't have to worry about managing servers; you just focus on your code. It's like renting a car instead of owning one. You get to use it when you need it without worrying about maintenance."

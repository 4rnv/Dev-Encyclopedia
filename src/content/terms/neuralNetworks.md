title: "Neural Networks"
subtext: "Brain-inspired AI"
description: "Neural networks are a set of algorithms, modeled loosely after the human brain, that are designed to recognize patterns. They interpret sensory data through a kind of machine perception, labeling, or clustering of raw input.

Imagine a neural network as a brain inside a machine that learns to recognize patterns in the same way humans do."

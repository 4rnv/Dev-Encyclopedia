title: "SaaS (Software as a Service)"
subtext: "On-demand software"
description: "SaaS is a software distribution model where applications are hosted by a service provider and made available to customers over the Internet. It eliminates the need for users to install and maintain software on their own devices.

Think of SaaS like Netflix for software; you use it when you need it without worrying about the technical details."

description: "In machine learning, an epoch is one complete pass through the entire training dataset. During each epoch, the model's parameters are updated to improve accuracy.<br><br>Multiple epochs are often needed for a model to learn effectively and reach high performance on the task it is trained for. However, its' crucial to determine the number of epochs carefully."

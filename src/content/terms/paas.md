description: "PaaS provides a platform that allows developers to build, run, and manage applications without dealing with the underlying infrastructure. It helps speed up development by providing tools and services needed to create applications.

Think of PaaS like a fully equipped kitchen where you can bake a cake without having to worry about buying ingredients or cleaning up."

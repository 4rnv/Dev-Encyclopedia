subtext: "Different kinds of data in programming"
description: "Data types define the kind of data a variable can hold. Common data types include integers (whole numbers), floats (decimal numbers), strings (text), and booleans (true or false).

Think of data types like different kinds of containers: a jar for jam, a box for toys, or a bottle for water."

title: "IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)"
subtext: "Cloud-based infrastructure"
description: "IaaS provides virtualized computing resources over the Internet. It allows businesses to rent servers, storage, and networking components on demand, paying only for what they use.

Think of IaaS like renting space in a data center instead of building your own. You get the resources you need without the overhead."

title: "Code Smell"
subtext: "A sign of trouble"
description: "A code smell is a sign in the code that something might be wrong. It doesn't mean the code is broken, but it suggests that it might be improved or fixed. Think of it like noticing a weird smell in your house. It doesn't mean there's definitely a fire, but it's worth checking out."

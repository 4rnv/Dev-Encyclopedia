description: "A deployment pipeline is a set of automated processes that ensure software changes go through various stages like building, testing, and deployment. It helps deliver high-quality software quickly and consistently.

Think of a deployment pipeline like an assembly line in a factory, where each step ensures the product is perfect before it reaches the customer."

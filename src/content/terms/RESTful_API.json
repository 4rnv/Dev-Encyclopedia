      "REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and conventions for building and interacting with web services. It uses HTTP requests to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations between a client and a server.",
      "REST APIs are stateless, meaning each request from a client to the server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. This makes them highly scalable and suitable for distributed environments."

description: "Deep learning is a subset of machine learning where artificial neural networks, algorithms inspired by the human brain, learn from large amounts of data. It's used in areas like image recognition, natural language processing, and game playing.

Imagine deep learning like teaching a robot by showing it thousands of examples until it gets really good at a task."

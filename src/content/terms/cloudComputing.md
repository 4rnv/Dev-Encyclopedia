description: "Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services like servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and more over the Internet. It offers faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

Think of cloud computing like renting a car instead of owning one; you get access to powerful computing resources when you need them without the responsibility of managing them."

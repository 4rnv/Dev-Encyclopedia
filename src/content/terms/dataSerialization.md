subtext: "Converting data formats"
description: "Data serialization is the process of converting data into a format that can be easily stored or transmitted and then reconstructed later. Common formats include JSON and XML.

Think of data serialization like packing a suitcase for a trip, making it easy to carry and unpack later."

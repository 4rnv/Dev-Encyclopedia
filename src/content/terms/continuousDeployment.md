subtext: "Automated software releases"
description: "Continuous Deployment is a software release process that automatically deploys every code change that passes automated tests to production. It ensures that the software is always up-to-date and can be quickly updated.

Imagine Continuous Deployment as a bakery where fresh bread is baked and put on shelves as soon as it's ready, ensuring customers always get the freshest products."
